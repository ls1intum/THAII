# Thaii

Thaii (Tool to analyze Human-AI-Interaction) is designed to provide users with insights into their AI usage for self-learning purposes. This research project aims to help users reflect on their interaction with conversational agents by tracking their usage and regulating their learning process. By offering these insights, Thaii seeks to reduce users' overdependency on conversational agents during their learning activities.
